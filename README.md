# Income Prediction

This is a machine learning model that utilizes the AdaBoost algorithm to predict income based on various attributes such as age, workclass, education, marital status, and more. By training on a dataset containing these features, the model can classify individuals into different income categories.

In addition, this project features a web application deployed on the Heroku platform, which serves as the focal point for experimenting with deploying an ML model using Flask. The web app allows users to input information such as age, education level, occupation, and other attributes to obtain predictions on income levels. Built using Flask, a popular Python web framework, the application provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the deployed model.

> [!NOTE] 
> The focus of this project is in the deployment side, not the model.
